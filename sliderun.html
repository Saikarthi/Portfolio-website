                        <p>Slide Run is a Endless game developed for learning purpose. Then I came up with a thought that why can't I develope further. </p>
                        <p>So I add some feautures. As like other Endless games, this game also have the same rules like miss track. </p>
                        <p>The unique thing I implemented is this game supports both FPP and TPP. The Obstacles are created according to the player's position, so that it will be challenging to play.</p> 
                        <p>At my first release to my friends for testing they came up with a bug that the obstacles are falling on our head. And then I fixed that bug and make the game clear.</p>
